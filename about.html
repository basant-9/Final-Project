  <header>Egyptian Sign Language: The Story</header>

  <section class="section">
    <h3 class="head">Egyptian Sign Language Education</h3>
        <p>The education of deaf individuals in Egypt began in the early 20th century. A significant milestone was reached around 1906 when Abdulla Iddleby founded a class for deaf boys in Cairo, representing one of the first structured efforts to educate the deaf community in the country. Today, there are approximately 113 schools for the Deaf across Egypt. However, the quality of education varies, with some institutions using ESL while others focus on oral methods.
          In March 2020, the Egyptian Ministry of Education announced the integration of Egyptian Sign Language (ESL) into school curricula. This initiative aims to bridge communication gaps between deaf students and educators, fostering a more inclusive educational environment.
